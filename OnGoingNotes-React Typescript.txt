->  Project setup:
    -   Node version >= 18
    -   At your desired project directory run command "yarn create vite .".
    -   yarn
    -   Delete unneccessary files
    -   yarn dev
    -   INSTALL: yarn add react-router-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    -   npx tailwindcss init -p
    -   Update ttailwind.config.js > content > "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    -   Include tailwind imports to main.css files
            @tailwind base;
            @tailwind components;
            @tailwind utilities;
    -   Import this file to main.tsx and update the App.tsx to test the css.

->  Into the project:
    -   Minor stylings done and Navbar set with a static cart button
    -   For store, data > storeItems.json created as static data. As images are needed those are also sourced acccrodingly.
    -   Created a StoreItem.tsx component to be rendered withing the Store.tsx component by looping each storeItem data.
    -   Inside the StoreItem.tsx file populating the data by mentioning the props type.
    -   As to format the price with according to the local Intl format, using a util > formatCurrency function that excepts a number and formats that in this case in USD.
    -   Added minor styling for the 'Add to cart' functionality.
As we are using static data, we will use useContext hook to create a providor and wrap the App with it.
    -   Create src > context > ShoppingCartContext.tsx (as it will return a Provider element) and a  useShoppingCart() context function.
    -   We then wrap the App element inside main.tsx file.
